# Financial Prediction and Analaysis

## Author: Dylan Smith
## Project Start: 2018-04-27
## Language: Python 3

This started as an independent learning project to download financial data and analyze both SEC filings and equity data from sources.  

## Data Spirces

1. SEC Filings (10-Q, 10-K) from Edgar Archives (2009 QTR1 - Present Day)

  -  Risk Factors from each companies' filing.  These are risks outlined by the company and are used to analyze risks to the market as a whole as well as understand future risks for each company.
  - Filing attributes from the xbrl data source.  The attributes that are isolated are the GAAP metrics that are set by an authoritative board and provide common reporting information across all companies

2. End of Day stock prices from TD Ameritrade's stocks (2009-01-01 -> Present Day)
3. News Articles: Both from the guardian news articles using 9 different sections and New York Times articles.

## Current Working Items

1. Should we display median on the volume?
2. Can we display values when they are clicked
